# Sleep Quality Predictor :crystal_ball:

This Jupyter Notebook represents my individual challenge in my semester 4 ICT & Artifical Intelligence Specialization at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.

## :computer: Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Analysis & Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

## :bulb: Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.8 or higher) 
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


## :fast_forward: Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project repository on your local machine.

### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ellyshiacheryltan/sleep-quality-predictor.git
```

### Installation
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install kagglehub pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn shap
```

## :bar_chart: Features
- Analysis of internal and external factors influencing sleep quality
- Implementation of a predictive model to predict one's sleep quality score
- Data visualization to highlight impactful factors
- Insights aimed at improving user-centered design and empathy

## :books: Dataset
The datasets are obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), the datasets featured in this notebook, specifically, are:
- [Sleep Cycle and Productivity dataset by Adil Shamim](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/sleep-cycle-and-productivity/data)
- [Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset by Laksika Tharmalingam](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset/data)
